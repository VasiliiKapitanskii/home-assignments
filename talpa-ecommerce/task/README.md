# Take-home Assignment
For the Data Engineer role at Talpa E-commerce.

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to allow you to show us how you would solve a Data Engineering problem without the pressure of a live coding exercise. We will ask you to explain your solution (thinking process, and code) in the second technical round and also use this as a conversation starter for chatting about other topics.

## The assignment

1. 📦 Create a private git repository and do your work in there as if this was a real project at work.  
Please share with us the repo once you're done.  

    ```
    # 1. Pull
    git clone git@github.com:EmesaDEV/data-engineer-assignment.git
    # 2. Create a private Git repo
    # 3. Add private remote
    git remote add dev <your-private-repo>
    # 4. Use git push to the private remote as you work
    ```

1. 👨‍🔧 Build a pipeline (batch or streaming) loading [data/sample.csv](data/sample.csv) into a database of choice.

2. 👨‍🔧 Build and deploy an API-endpoint to query the data. The endpoint should return a json response.

3. 📓 Explain your work in a README-file.

4. 👥 Share this repo with us:

## Guidelines

- 🕔 Do not spend more than 5 hours on *coding* this assignment. Designing and planning your work does not count into this limit.</br>
If there are things you really wanted to include, but had no time for them, explain them in the README.

- 🚀 Although this is small dummy data and a toy exercise, try aim for a production-grade solution. Think of scalability, maintainability, reliability.

- 👨‍💻 Use whatever technologies you want, feel free to get creative and add extra features.

- 🤔 Feel free to make assumptions and come up with requirements to make the assignment feel more real. Please note these down for us in the README.

- 💭 We don't have a concrete solution in mind.  
  We are interested in your thinking process, and the way you design and build a solution.
  
- 🤖 Feel free to use an AI coding assistant / LLM model, if that is your preferred workflow.  
We will still expect you to own the code, ie. be able to explain it in-depth, including why you (together with your coding assistant) decided to go for a certain solution, and what tradeoffs were made.
